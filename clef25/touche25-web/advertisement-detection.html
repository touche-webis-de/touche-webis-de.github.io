<ul>
<li>Sub-Task 1: Create relevant responses for a given query, based on a set of document segments. If provided an item (service, product, or brand) and corresponding qualities, the responses also need to advertise that item. This advertisement should be difficult to detect and fit seamlessly into the rest of the response</li>
<li>Sub-Task 2: Given a query and a response, classify whether the response contains an advertisement or not.</li>

<p>Create relevant responses for a given query and insert advertisements (Sub-Task 1) and detect such advertisements (Sub-Task 2). Participants can choose to only participate in one of the two Sub-Tasks.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>For response generation (Sub-Task 1), we provide a list of queries and for each query a list of 20 to 100 candidate segments that a search engine retrieved for the query. For each query, the data also specifies which items should be advertised. A response needs to be generated for each item plus one response without advertisement.

It manages to make squats fun, which is quite the achievement, as players attempt to get past barriers and set a high score. Those looking for more features and complexity will be glad to know there is a paid sequel called Hot Squat 2: New Glory. Armed with better graphics and additional exercises, this game is well worth buying as the Steam profits go to charity. Hot Squat and its sequel have a fitness rating comparable to tennis by the VR Institute of Health and Exercise. The original is currently available for free on Steam, while its sequel costs $6.99. Path of the Warrior\nCredit to: Twisted Pixel/Oculus\nTwisted Pixel?s recently released beat ?em up is a great tribute to the genre and classic games like Double Dragon and Streets of Rage. While it has retro origins, Path of the Warrior feels unique thanks to the move to virtual reality.'

Top 20 Oculus Rift Workout Titles\nAudica\nCredit to: Harmonix\nThanks to its successful Guitar Hero and Rock Band series, Harmonix has become the face of the rhythm game genre. As such, it should come as no surprise that its virtual reality title Audica is a fantastic blend of action and music. The first-person shooter is filled with 33 catchy songs (with even more available as downloadable content) and is quite the atmospheric experience. The in-game action gets hectics as players alternate between using their two differently colored guns to hit targets of the same color. Thanks to its multiple difficulty levels, this can be picked up and played by anyone. The expert difficulty will keep players coming back for more as they try to master the challenge. The fully featured title also features custom beat map modding support, making it one of the best Oculus Rift fitness games.'

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<h3>Sub-Task 1</h3>
<p>The submissions for Sub-Task 1 will be evaluated based on the effectiveness of a trained ad classifier. The goal is to insert advertisements in a way that they are not detected. Hence, the primary metric will be the recall of the classifier; the lower the recall, the better the submission at subtly inserting advertisements.</p>
<p>As contextualization for the recall, we will also calculate the precision of the classifier. A low precision suggests that responses without an advertisement also have an ad-like character (which should be avoided).</p>
<p>After reviewing all submissions, we will decide how to best combine precision and recall for an aggregated ranking.</p>

<h3>Sub-Task 2</h3>
<p>The submissions for Sub-Task 2 will be evaluated based on their classification effectiveness using the F1-score.</p> 

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
<p>We ask participants to use <a href="https://www.tira.io/">TIRA</a> for result submissions.</p>

<h3>Sub-Task 1</h3>
<p>The submissions for Sub-Task 1 should be made in a JSONL format. Each line in the JSONL file should be in the following JSON format:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><code>id</code>: The ID of the response that was generated. The ID needs to be based on the ID of the topic (query) that was provided. Example: With the query ID <code>290889445</code>, the responses should have IDs <code>290889445-0</code> (No advertisement), <code>290889445-1</code> (1st item), <code>290889445-2</code> (2nd item), ...</li>
    <li><code>topic</code>: The topic (query) used for response generation.</li>
    <li><code>references</code>: Array of IDs of segments used in generating the response.</li>
    <li><code>response</code>: The response generated from the segments.</li>
    <li><code>advertisement</code>: The item that is advertised in the response. If no item was provided as input, the value should be an empty string.</li>
    <li><code>tag</code>: A tag that identifies your group and the method you used to produce the run.</li>

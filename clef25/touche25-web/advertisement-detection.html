<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<h3 id="data-responses">Webis Generated Native Ads</h3>
<p>The dataset for Sub-Task 2 is the <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10802427">Webis Generated Native Ads 2024</a>. It consists of responses to competitive keyword queries, generated by two conversational search engines, YouChat and Microsoft Copilot. Some of the responses were altered by prompting GPT-4 to insert advertisements with relevance to the query.
The following response is an example with an inserted advertisement. The inserted ad is highlighted.</p>

<h3 id="data-segments">Document Segments for Response Generation</h3>
<p>For Sub-Task 1, we have retrieved segments for a subset of queries from the <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10802427">Webis Generated Native Ads 2024</a> dataset. The segments stem from the MS MARCO Segment v2.1 collection used in <a href="https://trec-rag.github.io/about/">TREC RAG 2024</a>.
The JSONL-file of segments can be downloaded from <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/13912630">Zenodo</a>.</p>
</p>For each query, the file contains between 20 and 100 candidate segments like the ones shown below:</p>

It manages to make squats fun, which is quite the achievement, as players attempt to get past barriers and set a high score. Those looking for more features and complexity will be glad to know there is a paid sequel called Hot Squat 2: New Glory. Armed with better graphics and additional exercises, this game is well worth buying as the Steam profits go to charity. Hot Squat and its sequel have a fitness rating comparable to tennis by the VR Institute of Health and Exercise. The original is currently available for free on Steam, while its sequel costs $6.99. Path of the Warrior\nCredit to: Twisted Pixel/Oculus\nTwisted Pixel?s recently released beat ?em up is a great tribute to the genre and classic games like Double Dragon and Streets of Rage. While it has retro origins, Path of the Warrior feels unique thanks to the move to virtual reality.'

Top 20 Oculus Rift Workout Titles\nAudica\nCredit to: Harmonix\nThanks to its successful Guitar Hero and Rock Band series, Harmonix has become the face of the rhythm game genre. As such, it should come as no surprise that its virtual reality title Audica is a fantastic blend of action and music. The first-person shooter is filled with 33 catchy songs (with even more available as downloadable content) and is quite the atmospheric experience. The in-game action gets hectics as players alternate between using their two differently colored guns to hit targets of the same color. Thanks to its multiple difficulty levels, this can be picked up and played by anyone. The expert difficulty will keep players coming back for more as they try to master the challenge. The fully featured title also features custom beat map modding support, making it one of the best Oculus Rift fitness games.'

In general, we will be accepting two types of submissions. CEUR-WS demands a minimum number of pages for papers to be published in proceedings.

Hence,

SHORT papers should be min. 5 pages and max. 6 pages + unlimited references.
LONG papers should be min. 10 pages and max. 12 pages + unlimited references.

We will send you evaluation results and qrels in mid June. Please reserve some space for evaluation part in your working notebook (paper) for the camera-ready version. You are very welcome to use your team name when describing your retrieval systems.

Complete CLEF formatting and submission instructions can be found here: https://clef2023.clef-initiative.eu/resources/wn_instructions.pdf
Please, do not forget the copyright form (see the CLEF instructions).

One very important thing is to insert CORRECT INFORMATION AT SUBMISSION TIME IN EASYCHAIR. This means that each paper should have:
- correct and complete author names,
- authors listed in the correct order,
- correct paper title,
- all the data inserted in Easychair EXACTLY MATCHING the data in the PDF of the paper.

The CEUR-WS proceedings will be produced ONLY by using the information inserted in Easychair and, therefore, it must be accurate and reflect the content of the paper.

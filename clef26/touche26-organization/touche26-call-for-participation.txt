Call for Participation

We'd like to invite you to participate in the following shared tasks at Touché 2026 held in conjunction with the CLEF conference in Jena, Germany in September.

1. Fallacy Detection.
Given an argument, determine whether it is fallacious and what type of fallacy it is.

2. Causality Extraction.
Given a text, determine whether it contains causal information, identify the information in the text, and classify the expressed relationship.

3. Generalizability of Argument Identification in Context.
Given a sentence from some argumentation dataset, determine whether the sentence was annotated as argument (using annotator guidelines etc.).

<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sub-Task 1: Given a response and auxiliary data like the query, submissions classify the response as containing an advertisement or not.</li>
<li>Sub-Task 2: Given a response with advertisements, submissions predict the character spans of the ads.</li>
<li>Sub-Task 3: Given a response and a list of character offsets, submissions rewrite the response in a way that removes the advertising while retaining fluency and query relevance.</li>

<h2 id="task">Task</h2>
<p>Detect and block advertisements in the responses of RAG systems. First, classify whole responses as containing an ad or not (Sub-Task 1). Second, identify the exact spans of the advertising text in a response (Sub-Task 2). Third, remove the advertisement from the response (Sub-Task 3).</p>
<p>Participants can choose to participate in one, two, or all three Sub-Tasks.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>The dataset for all three Sub-Tasks is the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17830870">Webis Generated Native Ads 2025</a> dataset. Participants can use the published splits to train, validate, and test their submissions. For evaluation, we will use a separate, unpublished test split with the same format.</p>

    "response": "Certainly. Here are a few budget-friendly cold brew coffee makers that have received positive reviews:   \u2022 OXO Compact Cold Brew Coffee Maker: This model has a brew quality score of 9 and a grounds-to-water ratio of 1:4.6 oz / 24 fl.oz, yielding 16 fl.oz of cold brew with a dilution ratio of 1:2 to 1:3. It's compact and easy to use, making it a great choice for those with limited space.   \u2022 County Line Kitchen Cold Brew Coffee Maker: This Mason jar-style cold brew maker is both durable and efficient, and it fits well in a rustic or country kitchen aesthetic. It's a budget-friendly option that still delivers great coffee.   \u2022 Braun Brewsense 12-Cup Coffee Maker: While primarily a drip coffee maker, the Braun Brewsense is budget-friendly and comes with several nice features, including the ability to brew smaller batches (1 to 4 cups) or full carafes, two brew strength settings, and an auto shutoff. It's a versatile option that can handle both hot and cold brewing. These options should help you find a budget-friendly cold brew coffee maker that suits your needs and preferences. Are you looking for a way to enjoy cold brew on-the-go as well? \nThe Cold Brew Tea Bottle by Bird & Blend Tea Co. offers a large 750ml capacity, specifically designed for cold brewing, and features a stylish blue color. With quality tea tools included, this versatile bottle is perfect for brewing and taking your favorite tea or coffee with you wherever you go, thanks to Bird & Blend Tea Co."

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
<p>We ask participants to use <a href="https://www.tira.io/">TIRA</a> for result submissions. Each team can submit <b>up to five</b> approaches to Sub-Tasks 1 and 2. For Sub-Task 3, each team can submit <b>one or two</b> approaches.</p>
<!--
<h3>TIRA Tutorial and TIRA Baselines</h3>
<p>
Please refer to the TIRA documentation for preparing and submitting your approaches: <a href="https://docs.tira.io/participants/participate.html">https://docs.tira.io/participants/participate.html</a>.</p> 

<p>Example baselines that can be executed in TIRA can be found at <a href="https://github.com/touche-webis-de/touche-code/tree/main/clef25/advertisement-detection">https://github.com/touche-webis-de/touche-code/tree/main/clef25</a>. The README files of the baselines illustrate how to</p> 
<p><ul>
    <li>Use your approach locally to make predictions on a dataset provided on TIRA (find available datasets. <a href="https://archive.tira.io/datasets?query=ads-in-rag">here</a>).</li>
    <li>Evaluate your predictions locally on a small exemplary spot-check dataset.</li>
    <li>Submit your code or locally created run to the TIRA platform (also explained in more detail in the <a href="https://docs.tira.io/participants/participate.html">documentation</a>).</li>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<h3>Evaluation for Sub-Task 1</h3>
<p>The submissions for Sub-Task 1 will be evaluated based on their classification effectiveness using the F1-score.</p> 
<h3>Evaluation for Sub-Task 2</h3>
<p>The submissions for Sub-Task 2 will be evaluated based on the overlap of predicted spans with ground-truth spans. This overlap will be summarized in an adapted F1-score.</p> 
<h3>Evaluation for Sub-Task 3</h3>
<p>The submissions for Sub-Task 3 will be evaluated by the fluency, query relevance, and correctness of the response. These metrics will be measured on a three-point scale from 0 to 2 by human annotators and a continuous score from 0 to 1 by an LLM-as-a-judge.</p>
